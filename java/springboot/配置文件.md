SpringApplication will load properties from application.properties files in the following locations and add them to the Spring Environment:

1. A /config subdirectory of the current directory.
2. The current directory
3. A classpath /config package
4. The classpath root

The list is ordered by precedence (properties defined in locations higher in the list override those defined in lower locations).

You can also use YAML ('.yml') files as an alternative to '.properties'.

If you donâ€™t like application.properties as the configuration file name you can switch to another by specifying a spring.config.name environment property. You can also refer to an explicit location using the spring.config.location environment property (comma-separated list of directory locations, or file paths).

```
java -jar myproject.jar --spring.config.name=myproject
java -jar myproject.jar --spring.config.location=classpath:/default.properties,classpath:/override.properties
```
